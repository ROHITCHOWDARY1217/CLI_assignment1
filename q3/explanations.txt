This command creates a new file named sample_data.txt in my home directory 
and writes sample text content into it.



The ln command creates a hard link named sample_hard.txt 
which points to the same inode as sample_data.txt.


The ln -s command creates a symbolic (soft) link named sample_soft.txt 
which stores only the path to the original file.


The ls -i command displays inode numbers of files. 
It helps in comparing which files share the same inode.




sample_data.txt and sample_hard.txt have the same inode number,
because a hard link refers to the same physical file on disk.
sample_soft.txt has a different inode because it is only a pointer (symbolic link).




The ls -l command shows permissions, ownership, size and timestamps of sample_data.txt. 
It helps verify file metadata and access control details.


The du -sh command displays the total disk usage of my home directory 
in a human-readable format.


This command lists the disk usage of each file and directory in my home folder 
in a readable size format.


I deleted only the symbolic link sample_soft.txt. 
The original file sample_data.txt remains unaffected because a soft link is only a reference.



The du command shows disk usage of files and directories. 
The df command displays filesystem space, total size, used space and free space.
Together they help analyze storage usage on the system.
